Hello there!

Q: What are all theese sources?
A: Most of 'em are exercises and problems I've solved @ school.

Q: Languages?
A: More than one. Mostly Java, but also C and a little bit of Perl.

Q: Who are you?
A: See http://santoro.tk

Q: Your codes are shitty.
A: Well, shit happens, and probably you're better as programmer than
me. Now I hope you're happy, so go trolling elsewere.
(I mean: constructive critics are OK, trolls aren't).

Q: Your code doesn't work/compile!!
A: Send bugfix/patches to santoro@autistici.org, if you want.

What else?
I often include Makefiles. If I do Not, just try yourself to compile the
sources.

If you are in troubles, feel free to ask a question to
santoro@autistici.org .


Cheers,
santoro@autistici.org
